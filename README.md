# LoboReader
LoboReader is an unofficial reader for the Internet Archive "Magazine Rack". It:
* automatically remembers magazines we are reading, along with reading progress
* its viewer component supports standard touch-based gestures (pinch-to-zoom with panning, double-tap-to-zoom, swipe-to-turn-pages etc.)

LoboReader is available as a standalone, client-side, mobile web application (it needs to be added to your mobile OS "Homescreen"). LoboReader fetches all the data from the Internet Archive directly to your device, and only stores the reading progress information locally (on your device).

# Requirements:
